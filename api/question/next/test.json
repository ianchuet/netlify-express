      "content": "<p>There are a few reasons why a 15-question Classic Qstream is the best recommendation in this case but the most important reason is that it aligns well with the client's main objectives which are:</p><ul><li>Reinforcement</li><li>Long Term Retention</li><li>3-month window of opportunity</li></ul><p>The client's priorities appear to be reinforcement and long term retention with no sense of urgency to launch or complete the Qstream in a short time-frame since their product isn't set to launch for 3-6 months. These objectives align perfectly with the Classic Qstream settings.</p><p>The best recommendation would be to use 15 of the most critical and relevant questions for a Classic Qstream that would run for approximately 8 weeks.</p><p>NOTE: If the client feels strongly about using all 30 questions, our recommendation would be to split the 30 questions into two Classic Qstreams and run one after the other with a reasonable break (2-3 weeks) in between.</p><p>We've found that engagement and completion rates tend to slow down or drop off when a Qstream runs for more than 8 weeks. Therefore, we'd advise against a 30 question Classic Qstream in this case (even with adjusted repeat settings), as the duration would be approximately 12 weeks.</p><p>Pharma customers tend to tolerate / prefer longer-lasting Qstreams as opposed to customers in the Financial Services and Technology verticals.</p>",
